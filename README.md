# monheAtzamim
The project is about main 4 classes: Monom , Polynom , ComplexFunction , Functions_GUI 
Monom represents a simple "Monom" of shape a*x^b, where a is a real number and a is an integer (summed a none negative)
Polynom represents a Polynom with add, multiply functionalityI(some monoms with math operations)
ComplexFunctions represents a complex function of type y=g(f1(x), f2(x)), where both f1, f2 are functions (or complex functions), 
y and x are real numbers and g is an operation: plus, mul, div, max, min, comp (f1(f2(x))).
Functions_GUI represents a collection of mathematical functions, which can be presented on a GUI window and can be saved (and load) to file.
